# Additional_Sculpt_Tools
A few additional buttons for sculpt and a few MISC stuff..

-Sculpt Symmetrize Blender's Symmetrize for sculpt is sort of limited. You always have to worry about -X to +X or vise-versa in each axis. So using mine allows you to find which position(- or +). Then it uses the Sculpt Mirror Brush axis to run each selected axis. This does not work with Shapekeys..

-Shrinkwrap Refresh This operation refreshes all shrinkwrap modifiers on the current selected model. Basically copies and applies the modifier. This also cannot run with shapekeys.

-Sculpt Context Menu (additions) Adding my Symmetrize buttons. Sculpt Mirror Brush axis and lock. Short amount of various additions.

-Panel Shrinkwrap Parts of the Sculpt Context Menu Global values
